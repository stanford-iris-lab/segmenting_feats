# Evaluation Code for R3M

The codebase contains the evaluation codebase from the paper [R3M: A Universal Visual Representation for Robot Manipulation](https://sites.google.com/view/robot-r3m/).

It trains policies from pixels with behavior cloning using pre-collected demonstrations, evaluating the policies in the environment at regular intervals. It allows for selecting different visual representations to use during imitation. 

## Environment Installation

The first step to running the code involves installing the evaluation environments.

For metaworld environments, install the environments by cloning this [fork of the metaworld repo](https://github.com/suraj-nair-1/metaworld) and installing via `pip install -e .`

In order to install the Franka Kitchen and Adroit environments, first install the `mjrl` repo using instructions [here](https://github.com/aravindr93/mjrl).

Then, install the `mj_envs` repo as described in [this tag](https://github.com/vikashplus/mj_envs/releases/tag/v0.0.5).

## Installing R3M

To use the R3M model, simply follow the installation process in the parent directory [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/r3m/tree/eval).

## Downloading Demonstration Data

All demonstrations are located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/108VW5t5JV8uNtkWvfZxEvY2P2QkC_tsf?usp=sharing). Then change the path [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/r3m/blob/eval/evaluation/r3meval/core/train_loop.py#L99) to point to where the demonstration data is located. Make sure the data is saved with the same folder structure as on the google drive, e.g. `<PATH TO DEMOS>/final_paths_multiview_meta_200/<CAMERA>/<TASK>.pickle`.

## Install and Run Eval Code

If the above was all done correctly, you should be able to simply run `pip install -e .` in this directory.

## Verifying Correct Installation

While running all experiments can be time consuming, a simple check to make sure things are behaving as expected is to download the demos for the kitchen sliding door task, and run:

```
python hydra_launcher.py hydra/launcher=local hydra/output=local env="kitchen_sdoor_open-v3" camera="left_cap2" pixel_based=true embedding=resnet50 num_demos=5 env_kwargs.load_path=r3m bc_kwargs.finetune=false proprio=9 job_name=r3m_repro seed=125
```
and 
```
python hydra_launcher.py hydra/launcher=local hydra/output=local env="kitchen_sdoor_open-v3" camera="left_cap2" pixel_based=true embedding=resnet50 num_demos=5 env_kwargs.load_path=clip bc_kwargs.finetune=false proprio=9 job_name=r3m_repro seed=125
```

You should see R3M get ~60% success on the first eval, while CLIP will get ~30%.


## Commands for All Experiments
